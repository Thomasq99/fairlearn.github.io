        "Postprocessing the model to get a fair model\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe idea behind postprocessing is to alter the output of the fairness-unaware\nmodel to achieve fairness. The postprocessing algorithm requires three input\narguments:\n- the matrix of samples X\n- the vector of predictions y from the fairness-unaware model\n- the vector of group attribute values A (in the code we refer to it as `sensitive_features`)\n\nThe goal is to make the output fair with respect to constraints. The\npostprocessing algorithm uses one of\n\n- Demographic Parity (DP):\n  $P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ |\\ A=a] = P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ ] \\qquad \\forall a, \\hat{y}$\n- Equalized Odds (EO):\n  $P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ |\\ A=a, Y=y] = P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ |\\ Y=y\\ ] \\qquad \\forall a, \\hat{y}$\n\nwhere $h(X)$ is the prediction based on the input $X$,\n$\\hat{y}$ and $y$ are labels, and $a$ is a sensitive feature\nvalue. In this example, we'd expect the postprocessed model with DP to be\nbalanced between races. In this particular scenario it makes more sense to\naim at fairness through accuracy like EO. EO does not make the same\nguarantees. Instead, it ensures parity between the subgroups of each race\nwith label 1 in the training set, and parity between the subgroups of each\nrace with label 0 in the training set. Applied to this scenario, this means\nthat the subgroups of each race who reoffended in the past are equally likely\nto be predicted to reoffend (and therefore also equally likely not to).\nSimilarly, there is parity between subgroups of each race without recidivism,\nbut we have no parity between the groups with different training labels. In\nmathematical terms at the example of African-American and Caucasian:\n\n\\begin{align}P\\ [\\ \\text{recidivism predicted}\\ |\\ \\text{African-American, recidivism}\\ ] = P\\ [\\ \\text{recidivism predicted}\\ |\\ \\text{Caucasian, recidivism}\\ ], \\text{e.g. } 0.95\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}P\\ [\\ \\text{recidivism predicted}\\ |\\ \\text{African-American, no recidivism}\\ ] = P\\ [\\ \\text{recidivism predicted}\\ |\\ \\text{Caucasian, no recidivism}\\ ], \\text{e.g. } 0.15\\end{align}\n\nbut that also means that African-Americans (and Caucasians) of different\nsubgroup based on training labels don't necessarily have parity:\n\n\\begin{align}P[\\text{recidivism predicted} | \\text{African-American, recidivism}] = 0.95 \\neq 0.15 = P[\\text{recidivism predicted} | \\text{African-American, no recidivism}]\\end{align}\n\nAssessing which disparity metric is indeed fair varies by application\nscenario. In this case the evaluation focuses on Equalized Odds, because the\nrecidivism prediction should be accurate for each race, and for each subgroup\nwithin. The plot for the training data shows the intended outcome, while the\nplot for the test data exhibits slight variation which is likely due to\nrandomized predictions as well as a slightly different data distribution.\n\nThis wrapper around the unconstrained estimator serves the purpose of mapping\nthe predict method to ``predict_proba``` so that we can use real values to get\nmore accurate estimates.\n\n"

That means that the area under the Caucasian curve is\nalso identical to the overlap. That does not always happen, though, and\noverlaps can be fairly complex with multiple intersecting curves defining its\noutline.\n\nWe can actually even look up the specific interpolations and interpret the\nresults. Keep in mind that these interpolations come up with a floating point\nnumber between 0 and 1, and represent the probability of getting 0 or 1 in\nthe predicted outcome.\n\nThe result for African-Americans is a combination of two thresholding rules.\nThe first rule checks whether the score is above 0.542, the other whether it\nis above 0.508. The first rule has a weight of 0.19, which means it\ndetermines 19% of the resulting probability. The second rule determines the\nremaining 81%. In the chart the Caucasian curve is below the African-American\ncurve at the EO solution. This means that there is a slight adjustment\naccording to the formula presented below.\n\nThe Caucasian rules have somewhat lower thresholds: The first rule's\nthreshold is >0.421 and it is basically the deciding factor with a weight of\n99.3%, while the second rule's threshold is >0.404.\n\nOverall, this means that the postprocessing algorithm learned to get\nprobabilities consistent with Equalized Odds and minimal error by setting\nlower thresholds for Caucasians than for African-Americans. The resulting\nprobability from the formula below is then the probability to get label 1\nfrom the probabilistic classifier.\n\nNote that this does not necessarily mean it's fair. It simply enforced the\nconstraints we asked it to enforce, as described by Equalized Odds. The\nsocietal context plays a crucial role in determining whether this is fair.\n\nThe parameters `p_ignore` and `prediction_constant` are irrelevant for cases\nwhere the curves intersect in the minimum error point. When that doesn't\nhappen, and the minimum error point is only part of one curve, then the\ninterpolation is adjusted as follows::\n\n  p_ignore * prediction_constant + (1 - p_ignore) * (p0 * operation0(score) + p1 * operation1(score))\n\nThe adjustment should happen to the higher one of the curves and essentially\nbrings it closer to the diagonal as represented by `prediction_constant`. In\nthis case this is not required since the curves intersect, but we are\nactually slightly inaccurate because we only determine the minimum error\npoint on a grid of x values, instead of calculating the intersection point\nanalytically. By choosing a large `grid_size` this can be alleviated.\n\n"
